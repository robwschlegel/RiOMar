# RiOMar

A collection of code used to process and analyse data relating to the [RiOMar project](https://riomar.lsce.ipsl.fr/).

Note that the majority of this code was originally written by [Louis Terrats](https://github.com/louis-terrats) under an MIT license and may be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/louis-terrats/myRIOMAR_dev).

The code is being repurposed in this repository as a continuation of the work previously performed, and with an eye towards the next two years of development. Terminating with the completion of the RiOMar project itself.

The primary objective of this repository is to provide a clear layout of the workflows used to verify the integrity of a number of data products, as well as any analyses used for publications.
