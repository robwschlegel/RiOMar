# RiOMar

A collection of code used to process and analyse data relating to the [RiOMar project](https://riomar.lsce.ipsl.fr/).

Note that the majority of the code in the __/func__ folder was originally written by [Louis Terrats](https://github.com/louis-terrats) under an MIT license and may be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/louis-terrats/myRIOMAR_dev) where it may be installed and used as a standalone module.

The code is being repurposed in this repository as a continuation of the work previously performed, and with an eye towards the next two years of development. Terminating with the completion of the RiOMar project itself.

The primary objective of this repository is to provide a clear layout of the workflows used to verify the integrity of a number of data products, as well as any analyses used for publications.

The workflow may be found in the __/code__ folder, with the order of operatioons given in the names of the scripts.
